# Question 3075: Maximum Happiness Sum

## Problem Description
Given an array `happiness` representing the happiness levels of individuals and an integer `k`, find the maximum happiness sum by selecting `k` individuals such that their happiness levels are adjusted as follows:

- The happiness level of the `i-th` selected individual is reduced by `i`.
- If the adjusted happiness level becomes non-positive, the individual is not selected.

## Step-by-Step Explanation

1. **Sort the Happiness Levels:**
   - Sort the `happiness` array in ascending order to prioritize the highest happiness levels.

2. **Iterate Through the Top `k` Individuals:**
   - Start from the highest happiness levels and adjust each individual's happiness by subtracting their position in the selection (`i`).
   - If the adjusted happiness level is non-positive, stop the selection process.

3. **Calculate the Sum:**
   - Add the adjusted happiness levels to the total sum.

4. **Return the Result:**
   - Return the total sum as the maximum happiness sum.

## Code Implementation

```java
class Solution_Q3075 {
    public long maximumHappinessSum(int[] happiness, int k) {
        java.util.Arrays.sort(happiness);
        long sum = 0;
        int n = happiness.length;
        for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
            int idx = n - 1 - i;
            int val = happiness[idx] - i;
            if (val <= 0) break;
            sum += val;
        }
        return sum;
    }
}
