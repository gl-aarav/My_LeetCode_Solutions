# Question 367: Valid Perfect Square

## Problem Description
Given a positive integer `num`, write a function that returns `true` if `num` is a perfect square, and `false` otherwise.

## Step-by-Step Explanation

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - A perfect square is a number that can be expressed as the square of an integer.
   - For example, 1, 4, 9, 16, etc., are perfect squares.

2. **Use the Sum of Odd Numbers Property:**
   - A perfect square can be expressed as the sum of the first `n` odd numbers.
   - For example:
     - 1 = 1
     - 4 = 1 + 3
     - 9 = 1 + 3 + 5
     - 16 = 1 + 3 + 5 + 7
   - This property can be used to determine if a number is a perfect square.

3. **Iterate Through Odd Numbers:**
   - Start with the first odd number (1).
   - Subtract the odd number from `num` and increment the odd number by 2.
   - Repeat until `num` becomes 0 or negative.

4. **Check the Result:**
   - If `num` becomes 0, it is a perfect square.
   - If `num` becomes negative, it is not a perfect square.

## Code Implementation

```java
class Solution_Q367 {
    public boolean isPerfectSquare(int num) {
        int odd = 1;
        while (num > 0) {
            num -= odd;
            odd += 2;
        }
        return num == 0;
    }
}
```
