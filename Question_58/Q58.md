# Question 58: Length of Last Word

## Problem Description
Given a string `s` consisting of words and spaces, return the length of the last word in the string. A word is defined as a maximal substring consisting of non-space characters only.

## Step-by-Step Explanation

1. **Skip Trailing Spaces:**
   - Start from the end of the string and skip all trailing spaces by decrementing the index until a non-space character is found.

2. **Count Characters of the Last Word:**
   - Once the trailing spaces are skipped, count the characters of the last word by iterating backward until another space is encountered or the beginning of the string is reached.

3. **Return the Length:**
   - Return the count of characters as the length of the last word.

## Code Implementation

```java
class Solution {
    public int lengthOfLastWord(String s) {
        int i = s.length() - 1;
        // skip trailing spaces
        while (i >= 0 && s.charAt(i) == ' ') {
            i--;
        }
        int length = 0;
        // count last word characters
        while (i >= 0 && s.charAt(i) != ' ') {
            length++;
            i--;
        }
        return length;
    }
}
```
