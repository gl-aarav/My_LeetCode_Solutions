# Question 279: Perfect Squares

## Problem Description
Given an integer `n`, return the least number of perfect square numbers that sum to `n`.

## Step-by-Step Explanation

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - A perfect square is a number that can be expressed as the square of an integer (e.g., 1, 4, 9, 16).
   - The goal is to find the minimum number of perfect squares that sum to `n`.

2. **Dynamic Programming Approach:**
   - Use an array `arr` where `arr[i]` represents the least number of perfect squares that sum to `i`.

3. **Initialization:**
   - Initialize `arr[i]` to `i` for all `i` (worst case: sum of `i` ones).

4. **Iterate Through Numbers:**
   - For each number `i` from 1 to `n`, iterate through all perfect squares less than or equal to `i`.
   - Update `arr[i]` to the minimum value between its current value and `arr[i - s] + 1`, where `s` is a perfect square.

5. **Return the Result:**
   - The value `arr[n]` gives the least number of perfect squares that sum to `n`.

## Code Implementation

```java
class SolutionQ279 {
    public int numSquares(int n) {
        int[] arr = new int[n + 1];
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            arr[i] = i; 
            for (int j = 1; j * j <= i; j++) {
                int s = j * j;
                if (arr[i - s] + 1 < arr[i]) {
                    arr[i] = arr[i - s] + 1;
                }
            }
        }
        return arr[n];
    }
}
```
