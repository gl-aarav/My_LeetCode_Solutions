# Question 27: Remove Element

## Problem Description
Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `val`, remove all occurrences of `val` in-place and return the new length of the array.

The relative order of the elements may be changed. It doesn't matter what values are left beyond the returned length.

## Approach
1. **Two Pointers**:
   - Use one pointer (`k`) to track the position of the next valid element.
   - Iterate through the array, copying elements that are not equal to `val` to the position indicated by `k`.

2. **In-place Modification**:
   - Overwrite elements in the array as needed.

3. **Return Result**:
   - Return `k` as the length of the modified array.

## Code
```java
class Solution {
    public int removeElement(int[] nums, int val) {
        int k = 0;
        for (int n : nums) {
            if (n != val) nums[k++] = n;
        }
        return k;
    }
}
```
