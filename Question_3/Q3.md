# Question 3: Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters

## Problem Description
Given a string `s`, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

## Step-by-Step Explanation

1. **Initialize Variables:**
   - Use an array `charCount` of size 128 to store the frequency of characters in the current window.
   - Use two pointers, `left` and `right`, to represent the sliding window.
   - Initialize `maxLength` to store the maximum length of the substring without repeating characters.

2. **Expand the Window:**
   - Iterate through the string using the `right` pointer.
   - Increment the count of the current character in `charCount`.

3. **Shrink the Window:**
   - If the count of the current character exceeds 1, move the `left` pointer to the right until the count of the current character becomes 1.
   - Decrement the count of characters as the `left` pointer moves.

4. **Update the Maximum Length:**
   - At each step, calculate the length of the current window (`right - left + 1`) and update `maxLength` if the current window is larger.

5. **Return the Result:**
   - Return `maxLength` as the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

## Code Implementation

```java
class SolutionQ3 {
    public int lengthOfLongestSubstring(String s) {
        int n = s.length();
        if (n == 0) {
            return 0;
        }

        int[] charCount = new int[128]; 

        int maxLength = 0;
        int left = 0;

        for (int right = 0; right < n; right++) {
            char currentChar = s.charAt(right);
            charCount[currentChar]++; 

            while (charCount[currentChar] > 1) {
                char leftChar = s.charAt(left);
                charCount[leftChar]--; 
                left++;
            }

            maxLength = Math.max(maxLength, right - left + 1);
        }

        return maxLength;
    }
}
```
