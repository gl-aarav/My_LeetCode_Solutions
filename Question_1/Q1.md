# Question 1: Two Sum

## Problem Description
Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return the indices of the two numbers such that they add up to the target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

## Approach
1. **Brute Force Solution**:
   - Iterate through each pair of numbers in the array.
   - Check if their sum equals the target.
   - If yes, return their indices.

2. **Implementation**:
   - Use two nested loops to iterate through all possible pairs.
   - Compare the sum of each pair with the target.
   - Return the indices of the pair if the sum matches the target.

## Code
```java
class Solution {
    public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
        int n = nums.length;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
                if (nums[i] + nums[j] == target) {
                    return new int[] {i, j};
                }
            }
        }
        return new int[] {};
    }
}
```
