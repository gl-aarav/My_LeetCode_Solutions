# Question 12: Integer to Roman

## Problem Description
Convert an integer to a Roman numeral.

Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: `I`, `V`, `X`, `L`, `C`, `D`, and `M`.

For example, 2 is written as `II` in Roman numeral, just two ones added together. 12 is written as `XII`, which is simply `X` + `II`. The number 27 is written as `XXVII`, which is `XX` + `V` + `II`.

## Approach
1. **Define Values and Symbols**:
   - Use two arrays to store the values and their corresponding Roman symbols.

2. **Iterate Through Values**:
   - Subtract the value from the number while appending the corresponding symbol to the result string.

3. **Return Result**:
   - Return the constructed Roman numeral string.

## Code
```java
class Solution {
    public String intToRoman(int num) {
        int[] values =    {1000, 900, 500, 400, 100,  90,  50,  40,  10,   9,   5,   4,   1};
        String[] symbols = {"M", "CM","D", "CD","C", "XC","L", "XL","X", "IX","V", "IV","I"};

        String str = "";

        for (int i = 0; i < values.length; i++) {
            while (num >= values[i]) {
                num -= values[i];
                str += symbols[i];
            }
        }

        return str;
    }
}
```
