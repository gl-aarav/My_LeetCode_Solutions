# Question 62: Unique Paths

## Problem Description
A robot is located at the top-left corner of a `m x n` grid. The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time. The robot is trying to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid. How many possible unique paths are there?

## Step-by-Step Explanation

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - The problem can be reduced to a combinatorial problem where the robot needs to make `(m - 1)` downward moves and `(n - 1)` rightward moves in any order.

2. **Calculate Total Moves:**
   - The total number of moves required is `m + n - 2`.

3. **Choose Downward Moves:**
   - Out of the total moves, choose `(m - 1)` downward moves (or equivalently `(n - 1)` rightward moves).

4. **Use Combinatorics Formula:**
   - The number of unique paths is given by the binomial coefficient:
     \[
     C(total, r) = \frac{total!}{r! \cdot (total - r)!}
     \]
   - Simplify the calculation to avoid overflow by iterating only up to `r = min(m - 1, n - 1)`.

5. **Iterative Calculation:**
   - Use a loop to calculate the result iteratively:
     \[
     result = result \cdot \frac{total - i + 1}{i}
     \]

6. **Return the Result:**
   - Convert the result to an integer and return it.

## Code Implementation

```java
class SolutionQ62 {
    public int uniquePaths(int m, int n) {
        int total = m + n - 2;        
        int r = Math.min(m - 1, n - 1); 
        long result = 1L;

        for (int i = 1; i <= r; i++) {
            result = result * (total - i + 1) / i;
        }

        return (int) result;
    }
}
```
