# Question 69: Sqrt(x)

## Problem Description
Given a non-negative integer `x`, compute and return the square root of `x`. Since the return type is an integer, the decimal digits are truncated, and only the integer part of the result is returned.

## Step-by-Step Explanation

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - The task is to compute the integer square root of a non-negative integer `x`.
   - The result should be truncated to an integer.

2. **Use Built-in Functionality:**
   - Java provides a built-in method `Math.sqrt` to compute the square root of a number.
   - Cast the result of `Math.sqrt` to an integer to truncate the decimal part.

3. **Return the Result:**
   - Directly return the truncated result of `Math.sqrt(x)`.

## Code Implementation

```java
class Solution_Q69 {
    public int mySqrt(int x) {
        return (int) (Math.sqrt(x));
    }
}
```
