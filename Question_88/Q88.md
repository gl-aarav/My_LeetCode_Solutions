# Question 88: Merge Sorted Array

## Problem Description
You are given two integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2`, sorted in non-decreasing order, and two integers `m` and `n`, representing the number of elements in `nums1` and `nums2`, respectively. Merge `nums2` into `nums1` as one sorted array.

The final sorted array should not be returned by the function, but instead be stored inside the array `nums1`. To accommodate this, `nums1` has a length of `m + n`, where the first `m` elements denote the elements that should be merged, and the last `n` elements are set to 0 and should be ignored.

## Step-by-Step Explanation

1. **Initialize Pointers:**
   - Use three pointers: `i` for the last valid element in `nums1`, `j` for the last element in `nums2`, and `k` for the last position in `nums1`.

2. **Merge in Reverse Order:**
   - Start from the end of both arrays and compare the elements at `nums1[i]` and `nums2[j]`.
   - Place the larger element at `nums1[k]` and decrement the respective pointer.

3. **Handle Remaining Elements:**
   - If there are remaining elements in `nums2`, copy them into `nums1`.

4. **Return the Result:**
   - The merged array is stored in `nums1`.

## Code Implementation

```java
class Solution_Q88 {
    public void merge(int[] nums1, int m, int[] nums2, int n) {
        int i = m - 1;
        int j = n - 1;
        int k = m + n - 1;

        while (j >= 0) {
            if (i >= 0 && nums1[i] > nums2[j]) {
                nums1[k] = nums1[i];
                i--;
            } else {
                nums1[k] = nums2[j];
                j--;
            }
            k--;
        }
    }
}
```
